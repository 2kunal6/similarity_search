r"""     Computes the throat capillary entry pressure assuming the throat has a     sinusoisal profile.     Makes use of the toroidal meniscus model with mode touch.     This model accounts for mensicus protrusion into adjacent pores and     touching solid features.

Parameters     ----------     target : OpenPNM Object         The object for which these values are being calculated.  This         controls the length of the calculated array, and also provides         access to other necessary thermofluid properties      num_points : float (Default 100)         The number of divisions to make along the profile length to assess the         meniscus properties in order to find the touch length.      surface_tension : dict key (string)         The dictionary key containing the surface tension values to be used.         If a pore property is given, it is interpolated to a throat list.      contact_angle : dict key (string)         The dictionary key containing the contact angle values to be used.         If a pore property is given, it is interpolated to a throat list.      throat_diameter : dict key (string)         The dictionary key containing the throat diameter values to be used.      throat_amplitude : dict key (string)         The dictionary key containing the amplitude of variation in the throat         diameter about the mean.      throat_length : dict key (string)         The dictionary key containing the throat length values to be used.      pore_diameter : dict key (string)         The dictionary key containing the pore diameter values to be used.

Restore the backup as a named key.          This will restore the key configurations and all the versions of the named key along with HMAC keys. The input         to this endpoint should be the output of /backup endpoint. For safety, by default the backend will refuse to         restore to an existing key. If you want to reuse a key name, it is recommended you delete the key before         restoring. It is a good idea to attempt restoring to a different key name first to verify that the operation         successfully completes.          Supported methods:             POST: /{mount_point}/restore(/name). Produces: 204 (empty body)          :param backup: Backed up key data to be restored. This should be the output from the /backup endpoint.         :type backup: str | unicode         :param name: If set, this will be the name of the restored key.         :type name: str | unicode         :param force: If set, force the restore to proceed even if a key by this name already exists.         :type force: bool         :param mount_point: The "path" the method/backend was mounted on.         :type mount_point: str | unicode         :return: The response of the request.         :rtype: requests.Response

If the VLAN             keyword is used, then the VTEP is configured as a local flood             endpoing          Returns:             True if the command completes successfully
Pops all used working registers after function call
Register a function as being part of an API, then returns the original function.
Returns the ids from users that have verified at least one analysis         from this Analysis Request
return a string containing script parameters.      Parameters are all variables that start with ``param_``.
Helper method to add pores to the cluster queue
Diff two primitive arrays
Compute AnalysisProfileVATAmount

Returns this AST with subexpressions replaced by those that can be found in `replacements` dict.          :param variable_set:    For optimization, ast's without these variables are not checked for replacing.         :param replacements:    A dictionary of hashes to their replacements.         :param leaf_operation:  An operation that should be applied to the leaf nodes.         :return:                An AST with all instances of ast's in replacements.
Sets the percentage of this OrderLineItemTax.         The percentage of the tax, as a string representation of a decimal number.  A value of `7.25` corresponds to a percentage of 7.25%.          :param percentage: The percentage of this OrderLineItemTax.         :type: str
Return a UID so that ReferenceField understands.
Prepare and send email to the recipients          :param recipients: a list of email or name,email strings         :param subject: the email subject         :param body: the email body         :param attachments: list of email attachments         :returns: True if all emails were sent, else false
Subclasses may override this method.
Load up a single vector tile.
A reference to the slide in this presentation that is the target of         the slide jump action in this shape. Slide jump actions include         `PP_ACTION.FIRST_SLIDE`, `LAST_SLIDE`, `NEXT_SLIDE`,         `PREVIOUS_SLIDE`, and `NAMED_SLIDE`. Returns |None| for all other         actions. In particular, the `LAST_SLIDE_VIEWED` action and the `PLAY`         (start other presentation) actions are not supported.          A slide object may be assigned to this property, which makes the         shape an "internal hyperlink" to the assigened slide::              slide, target_slide = prs.slides[0], prs.slides[1]             shape = slide.shapes[0]             shape.target_slide = target_slide          Assigning |None| removes any slide jump action. Note that this is         accomplished by removing any action present (such as a hyperlink),         without first checking that it is a slide jump action.
Compute Mel-filterbank energy features from an audio signal.          Args:          signal (array): the audio signal from which to compute features.              Should be an N x 1 array          sampling_frequency (int): the sampling frequency of the signal              we are working with.          frame_length (float): the length of each frame in seconds.              Default is 0.020s          frame_stride (float): the step between successive frames in seconds.              Default is 0.02s (means no overlap)          num_filters (int): the number of filters in the filterbank,              default 40.          fft_length (int): number of FFT points. Default is 512.          low_frequency (float): lowest band edge of mel filters.              In Hz, default is 0.          high_frequency (float): highest band edge of mel filters.              In Hz, default is samplerate/2      Returns:               array: features - the energy of fiterbank of size num_frames x num_filters. The energy of each frame: num_frames x 1
