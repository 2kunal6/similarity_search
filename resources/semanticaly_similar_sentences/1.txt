Add a new VRF. Valid keys in the `args`-struct: * `auth` [struct] Authentication options passed to the :class:`AuthFactory`. * `attr` [struct] VRF attributes. Returns the internal database ID for the VRF.

Create a fresh VRF instance. Accepted parameters in the args structure include: * auth [structure] Authentication configurations forwarded to the :class:AuthFactory. * attr [structure] Attributes specific to the VRF. Provides the unique database identifier for the newly added VRF.
Instantiate a new VRF. Supported fields within the args structure: * auth [object] Authentication configurations sent to the :class:AuthFactory. * attr [object] VRF properties. Furnishes the internal database ID associated with the VRF upon addition.
Establish a VRF entry. Recognized properties within the args structure: * auth [object] Authentication parameters transmitted to the :class:AuthFactory. * attr [object] VRF characteristics. Retrieves the internal database ID assigned to the newly created VRF.
Append a fresh VRF. Allowed fields in the args structure: * auth [object] Authentication settings forwarded to the :class:AuthFactory. * attr [object] VRF attributes. Fetches the internal database ID linked to the VRF after insertion.
Introduce a new VRF record. Permissible keys in the args structure: * auth [object] Authentication configurations forwarded to the :class:AuthFactory. * attr [object] VRF properties. Provides the internal database ID for the newly inserted VRF.
Register a fresh VRF entity. Accepted parameters in the args structure: * auth [object] Authentication options sent to the :class:AuthFactory. * attr [object] VRF attributes. Supplies the internal database ID corresponding to the added VRF.
Incorporate a novel VRF instance. Supported fields within the args structure: * auth [object] Authentication settings transmitted to the :class:AuthFactory. * attr [object] VRF characteristics. Delivers the internal database ID associated with the newly appended VRF.
